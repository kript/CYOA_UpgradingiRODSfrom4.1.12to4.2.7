# CYOA_UpgradingiRODSfrom4.1.12to4.2.7
Choose Your Own Adventure - Upgrading iRODS from 4.1.12 to 4.2.7

An interactive text based, web story about the effort up upgrade an iRODS installation from one major version to another.

Built with (Ink)[https://github.com/inkle/ink], and distributed/playable on (itch.io)[https://kript.itch.io/upgrading-irods-from-4112-to-427]

Apologies for the lack of working hyperlinks, but the released version of Ink doesn't support the commit for Issue 266, so they get stripped out. 

(iRODS)[https://irods.org] is a product of RENCI.

This was inspired in large part by spending formative years playing Fighting Fantasy, and also by Robin Sloan's (recent project)[https://www.robinsloan.com/overworld/week/8]
